# This workflow will build a Java project with Maven, and cache/restore any dependencies to improve the workflow execution time
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-java-with-maven

# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

  uses: actions/setup-node@v4.2.0
  with:
    # Set always-auth in npmrc.
    always-auth: # optional, default is false
    # Version Spec of the version to use. Examples: 12.x, 10.15.1, >=10.15.0.
    node-version: # optional
    # File containing the version Spec of the version to use.  Examples: package.json, .nvmrc, .node-version, .tool-versions.
    node-version-file: # optional
    # Target architecture for Node to use. Examples: x86, x64. Will use system architecture by default.
    architecture: # optional
    # Set this option if you want the action to check for the latest available version that satisfies the version spec.
    check-latest: # optional
    # Optional registry to set up for auth. Will set the registry in a project level .npmrc and .yarnrc file, and set up auth to read in from env.NODE_AUTH_TOKEN.
    registry-url: # optional
    # Optional scope for authenticating against scoped registries. Will fall back to the repository owner when using the GitHub Packages registry (https://npm.pkg.github.com/).
    scope: # optional
    # Used to pull node distributions from node-versions. Since there's a default, this is typically not supplied by the user. When running this action on github.com, the default value is sufficient. When running on GHES, you can pass a personal access token for github.com if you are experiencing rate limiting.
    token: # optional, default is ${{ github.server_url == 'https://github.com' && github.token || '' }}
    # Used to specify a package manager for caching in the default directory. Supported values: npm, yarn, pnpm.
    cache: # optional
    # Used to specify the path to a dependency file: package-lock.json, yarn.lock, etc. Supports wildcards or a list of file names for caching multiple dependencies.
    cache-dependency-path: # optional
          
            - name: Cache
  uses: actions/cache@v3.4.3
  with:
    # A list of files, directories, and wildcard patterns to cache and restore
    path: 
    # An explicit key for restoring and saving the cache
    key: 
    # An ordered list of keys to use for restoring stale cache if no cache hit occurred for key. Note `cache-hit` returns false in this case.
    restore-keys: # optional
    # The chunk size used to split up large files during upload, in bytes
    upload-chunk-size: # optional
    # An optional boolean when enabled, allows windows runners to save or restore caches that can be restored or saved respectively on other platforms
    enableCrossOsArchive: # optional, default is false
    # Fail the workflow if cache entry is not found
    fail-on-cache-miss: # optional, default is false
    # Check if a cache entry exists for the given input(s) (key, restore-keys) without downloading the cache
    lookup-only: # optional, default is false
